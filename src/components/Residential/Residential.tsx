                Once construction commences, our skilled in-house tradesmen,
                supported by a select group of subcontractors, take charge of
                the build. Dedicated Project and Site Managers oversee the
                progress and stay in constant contact with your Business
                Relationship Manager and our Cost Control Managers, ensuring you
                are consistently updated. We are committed to your satisfaction
                at every phase, with the option for face-to-face meetings or
                project walkthroughs, complemented by an online project
                management system offering access to live project data at any
                time.
